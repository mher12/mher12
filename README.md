## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
<p>
I'm Mainia (my-nya)! I'm a proud graduate of Toccoa Fall College where I received my Bachelor of Science degree in Christian Education. This degree focuses on creating, organization, and reviewing the efficacies of ministries within the church organization. I am currently a senior disclosure analyst with a mid-size mortgage lender to which i've worked with for about 13 years. With data all around us, I decided to jump into a data analytics in pursuit of how data can make an impact and open doors for us whether it be in a personal or professional setting. 
</p>
<p></p>
This curiosity and thirst for knowledge led me to enroll as a student in the Goodwill Data Analytics programs where I have learned to extract, load, and transform data to derive meaningful insights using various tools and programs. Check out what I have been up to! Asides from learning to use different tool and techniques, I get to help others with my skills which brings me personal satisfaction! 
</p>
<p>
I would love to connect to see what I can do to help you, or if you have any feedback, I would love to learn and grow together as I truly believe in being a life long learner!
