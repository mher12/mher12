## About
## Mainia Her - Data Analysis Portfolio
### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Mainia (my-nya)! I'm a proud graduate of Toccoa Fall College where I received my Bachelor of Science degree in Christian Education. This degree focuses on creating, organization, and reviewing the efficacies of ministries within the church organization. I am currently a senior disclosure analyst with a mid-size mortgage lender to which i've worked with for about 13 years. With data all around us, I decided to jump into a data analytics in pursuit of how data can make an impact and open doors for us whether it be in a personal or professional setting. 
</p>
<p></p>
This curiosity and thirst for knowledge led me to enroll as a student in the Goodwill Data Analytics programs where I have learned to extract, load, and transform data to derive meaningful insights using various tools and programs. Check out what I have been up to! This repository serves to showcase my skills and as a platform to share my projects, and a way to track my progress in Data Analytics related topics. Asides from learning to use different tool and techniques, I get to help others with my skills which brings me personal satisfaction! 
</p>
<p>
I would love to connect to see what I can do to help you, or if you have any feedback, I would love to learn and grow together as I truly believe in being a life long learner!
</p>

## Self Paced Study Projects
In this section I will provide links to my github repositories containing assigments I created while passing online courses or while just having fun with data and code.

### Learning SQL - Covid Population
**Description:** SQL queries for tasks from [AlexTheDataAnalyst](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfyynHBFOsM&list=PLUaB-1hjhk8H48Pj32z4GZgGWyylqv85fttps://karpov.courses/simulator-ab).  
This self-paced course explores such topics understanding the basics to intermediate syntax of SQL.
**Repository:** Check the repository ---> [go to repo..](https://github.com/mher12/PortfolioProjectsSQL/tree/main)  
**Status:** Some courses are still in progress

## Certificates
I believe that the best way to showcase skills is by doing and sharing your job done but sometimes certificates appear to be as an indirect result:) So here is a list of the ones I have (in reverse-chronological order, with the date of completion in brackets):
- [Introduction to Career Skills in Data Analytics](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rGfXuVLWLkxzrPLE-NgHizMN-tpoZibA/view) (Jun 2023) (karpov.courses)
