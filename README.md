## About
## Mainia Her - Data Analysis Portfolio
### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Mainia (my-nya)! I'm a proud graduate of Toccoa Fall College where I received my Bachelor of Science degree in Christian Education. This degree focuses on creating, organization, and reviewing the efficacies of ministries within the church organization. I am currently a senior disclosure analyst with a mid-size mortgage lender to which i've worked with for about 13 years. With data all around us, I decided to jump into a data analytics in pursuit of how data can make an impact and open doors for us whether it be in a personal or professional setting. 
</p>
<p></p>
This curiosity and thirst for knowledge led me to enroll as a student in the Goodwill Data Analytics programs where I have learned to extract, load, and transform data to derive meaningful insights using various tools and programs. Check out what I have been up to! This repository serves to showcase my skills and as a platform to share my projects, and a way to track my progress in Data Analytics related topics. Asides from learning to use different tool and techniques, I get to help others with my skills which brings me personal satisfaction! 
</p>
<p>
I would love to connect to see what I can do to help you, or if you have any feedback, I would love to learn and grow together as I truly believe in being a life long learner!

## Portfolio Projects
In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to perform analysis and analytics to generate insights.

### Employee Report
**Code:** [`Employee Salary Report`](https://github.com/mher12/ExcelSalesReport/tree/main)    
**Description:** The dataset contained two tables. One table contains Employee department and salary information with 50 records. The second contains the bonus amount in which are associated to each employee with 44 records. The task was to clean up the data set and perform statistical analysis and create a relationship between two tables using X-Lookup.  
**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, descriptive statistics  
**Technology:** Excel.  
**Results:** Review Employee demographics and assigne appropriate bonus percentage accordingly.  

### Video Games Sales Analysis
**Code:** [`video_games_sales.ipynb`](https://github.com/nktnlx/data_analysis_portfolio/blob/main/video_games_sales.ipynb)    
**Description:** The dataset contains 16715 records as of 2016. There is a list of video games with sales (by region), year of release, platform, critics and users score. The project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing, filling missing values, EDA (exploratory data analysis), analyzing region based user profiles, measuring statistical factors, hypothesis testing.  
**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, descriptive statistics, central limit theorem, hypothesis testing, data visualization.  
**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Scipy Stats, Seaborn, Matplotlib.  
**Results:** Review of the global and regional video games markets, data-based business recommendations.  

## Self Paced Study Projects
In this section I will provide links to my github repositories containing assigments I created while passing online courses or while just having fun with data and code.

### Learning SQL - Covid Population
**Description:** SQL queries for tasks from [AlexTheDataAnalyst](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfyynHBFOsM&list=PLUaB-1hjhk8H48Pj32z4GZgGWyylqv85fttps://karpov.courses/simulator-ab).  
This self-paced course explores such topics understanding the basics to intermediate syntax of SQL.
**Repository:** Check the repository ---> [go to repo..](https://github.com/mher12/PortfolioProjectsSQL/tree/main)  
**Status:** Some courses are still in progress

## Certificates
I believe that the best way to showcase skills is by doing and sharing your job done but sometimes certificates appear to be as an indirect result:) So here is a list of the ones I have (in reverse-chronological order, with the date of completion in brackets):
- [Advanced A/B Testing Course](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rGfXuVLWLkxzrPLE-NgHizMN-tpoZibA/view) (Jun 2023) (karpov.courses)
- [Algorithms Training 3.0 by Yandex](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EQ5p0F_acNAXgnKBhgGhxLl-8W6HlCid/view?usp=sharing) (Apr 2023) (Yandex)
